In September 2016 we [reported that commuters spend more than a tenth of disposable income on annual rail season tickets](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-37166033).

The data came from analysis of season ticket prices for the most popular commuter routes by Dan Wainwright, combined with data on local earnings, and data on route distances. Analysis was based on full time workers using an annual season ticket five days a week.

Season ticket price data was compiled manually by entering the most commonly used commuter services in six major cities (obtained from the Campaign for Better Transport) into the [National Rail season ticket calculator](http://ojp.nationalrail.co.uk/service/seasonticket/search)

Route distances were calculated using the [Google Places Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/intro).
